# VAR_COMM — single source worktree

## Completed Kodak24 generalization experiment (2026-10-09)

[Results and delivery index](results/generalization_kodak_20261009/README.md): all 24 predetermined 256x256 center crops, N1024, 4/10/19 dB, three noises, and four frozen methods completed 864 reconstruction frames. Unconditional VAR uses the null embedding; there was no training or Kodak calibration/policy selection. Four metrics, source-paired intervals, resource/configuration tables, and fixed-source visualizations are complete. The independent 1080-call PHY budget closed; the original root ledger remains 534231.

DINOv2-L similarity and source-prediction agreement favor the proposed method against every baseline at all three SNRs in pointwise paired intervals. The report retains the tradeoffs: PSNR is below adaptive BPG at all three SNRs, and 4 dB LPIPS is worse than latent continuous JSCC. Four 10 dB body-CRC failures remain in the prescribed KEEP population. Swin 19 dB is outside its training/calibration range. These 24 fixed crops provide limited cross-collection evidence, not full-resolution Kodak evaluation or proof of pretrained-data non-overlap. Earlier common500 results remain unchanged; historical monitors remain paused.


## Latest completed supplement (2026-10-09)

[Paper supplement and result index](results/paper_supplement_20261008/PUBLICATION.md): the A-class first round is complete, including the later-added adaptive BPG + LDPC baseline (500 sources x 6 SNRs x 3 noises), four metrics and source-paired comparisons, native Swin checks, five-method single-output timings, resource/failure tables and paper figures. The original frozen common500 results at commit `252176e` remain unchanged.

Adaptive BPG has higher PSNR at every tested SNR; the proposed method has better LPIPS, DINOv2-L and source-prediction agreement. All points and negative findings are retained. Swin at 19 dB is outside its training/calibration range; native256 BPG timings do not measure the adaptive source search. External native replication and B/C extensions remain conditional and were not started. No training or new scientific work is triggered by this publication; the monitor remains paused.


The actual project root is now the sole Git worktree for `daiqizai/var-comm`.
Edit, run, test, commit and push here. `publish/var-comm` is retained locally as an ignored historical backup; no source-copy or separate publication workflow is required.

## Latest completed study (2026-09-30)

[Frozen P4084 Step2 A conclusions](results/rx_posterior_step2_A_20260930_R1/report_reviewed.md) and
[complete results with exact table restoration](results/rx_posterior_step2_A_20260930_R1/README.md).
The run has zero training updates. Policies bypass at 1/4/7/13 dB; -5/-2 dB
outside the original training range exceed B2/A1/A2 with common-weight support,
at about 125 ms versus 13 ms receive time. B/P_low and Step3 require a separate
decision. [Execution and asset guide](experiments/rx-posterior-step2-A-20260930/README.md).

## Earlier study registration (2026-09-23 snapshot)

The following entries preserve earlier study registrations and runtime snapshots;
they do not restart the currently paused historical queues.

[Token/channel efficiency supplement](experiments/token_channel_efficiency_20260923/README.md)
adds source-codec accounting, P2048/P3060 and real16QAM. A/B now precede unstarted
short-prefix training; the active cache finishes unchanged. New holdout and
content selectors are deferred. Experiment A is complete; see [actual source ledger and representation report](reports/token_channel_efficiency_20260923_source_A.md).
P2048/P3060 real-device qualification passed and budget training is ongoing.
Runtime receipts distinguish implemented code from NOT_RUN real experiments.


[Short-prefix protocol and execution](experiments/var-short-prefix-hybrid-20260923/README.md): real preflight/qualification complete; full training and later evaluation stages pending.

## Completed review and bounded study

- [Phase1 repairs and affected real-weight results](reports/review_20260923_phase1.md).
- [Phase2 real experiments, numerical-protocol correction and measured tradeoffs](reports/review_20260923_phase2.md).
- [Phase2 evidence and run identities](results/review_20260923_phase2/README.md).
- [Actual execution commands and preserved launch history](experiments/var-latent-enhancement-20260917/research/EXECUTION.md).

These runs preserve original A/B and use the existing development population. They do not certify every historical issue, open a new holdout, or complete m10/new-Decoder digital adaptation.

## Check a checkout

```bash
python tools/verify_repository.py
python tools/run_cpu_checks.py
```

CPU checks require Python 3.10+, numpy, torch, PyYAML, LPIPS/torchvision and pytest (see requirements-cpu.txt). They use source from this checkout and include synthetic engineering tests and stored-result validation. They do not train models or recompute real image quality. External weights, datasets, caches and third-party implementations remain local and are not distributed. Historical GPU asset paths may need configuration on another host.

## Contents and provenance

- `src/`, `experiments/`, `scripts/`: actual execution code, configurations and tests.
- `src/cadsd_jscc/`: the small self-written historical runtime dependency closure, with source hashes in the migration records. External model libraries are not bundled.
- `tools/`, `tests/`: repository checks and lightweight result reproduction.
- `results/`: historical published data plus selected lightweight run artifacts, with run IDs and original hashes. `outputs/` remains in place and ignored.
- `reports/`, `docs/`: scientific evidence and scope limitations.
- [Migration record](reports/repository_migration_20260923.md).
- [Research status](RESEARCH_STATUS.md) and [historical result index](docs/RESULTS_INDEX.md).

Repository migration does not certify the previous repair task as complete. No original A/B training, new method, or GPU quality evaluation is part of this migration.
